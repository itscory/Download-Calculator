# Download-Calculator
A simple javascript website that calculates download time, given the download speed and size.

I once wanted to calculate a download time when I wasn't given an ETA from terminal, and the best site I could find to do this was [this](http://download.stormloader.com/). I feel like it can be done better. I'd like the site to look similar to [CoinB.in](https://coinb.in/) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/OutCast3k/coinbin/). I'm sure they won't mind if we use their code as foundation since they use the MIT License. But don't let me dictate how you contribute! That's just how I do.

Feel free to fork, commit changes, and open pull requests. I promise I will review them quickly, and if the changes are better than the original, I will merge it.

Also, if you find an issue, even if you don't know how to fix it, you're more than welcome to address it by opening an issue.

An issue has been open for discussing a site name and finding a domain for it.
